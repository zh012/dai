# Spec-Driven Development Kit

This kit provides a collection of templates, workflows, and prompts to facilitate AI-assisted software development, grounded in the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Overview

The goal of this kit is to structure the development process, ensuring that all software changes are backed by clear specifications. This approach helps to:

-   **Align** stakeholders, designers, and developers.
-   **Reduce** ambiguity and rework.
-   **Improve** code quality and maintainability.
-   **Leverage** AI assistance effectively and safely.

## Components

-   **`/templates`**: A set of standardized templates for key software development documents.
-   **`/workflows`**: Step-by-step guides for both new (greenfield) and existing (brownfield) projects.
-   **`/prompts`**: Prompts to establish a consistent and effective AI persona for development tasks.

## How to Use

1.  **Choose a workflow**: Select the appropriate workflow for your project (`greenfield` or `brownfield`).
2.  **Follow the steps**: The workflow will guide you through the process of filling out the necessary templates.
3.  **Use the prompts**: Utilize the prompts to instruct the AI assistant at each stage of the workflow.
