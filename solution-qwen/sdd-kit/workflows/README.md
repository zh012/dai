# Spec-Driven Development Workflows

This directory contains documented workflows for implementing Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology in both greenfield (new) and brownfield (existing systems) projects. Each workflow integrates Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to guide AI-assisted software development.

## Workflow Types

### Greenfield Development (`greenfield-workflow.md`)
- Designed for creating new software systems from scratch
- Emphasizes domain discovery and clean architecture design
- Incorporates iterative domain modeling and specification refinement

### Brownfield Development (`brownfield-workflow.md`)
- Designed for enhancing or refactoring existing systems
- Focuses on understanding and modeling existing domains
- Emphasizes incremental improvements and legacy system integration

## Core Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Use domain expertise to drive software design
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation
3. **Specification-First**: Define clear specifications before coding
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improve specifications and models
5. **Ubiquitous Language**: Use consistent terminology throughout the project
6. **AI Assistance**: Leverage AI tools to accelerate the development process
