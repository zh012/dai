# Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Kit

A comprehensive toolkit for implementing Spec-Driven Development methodology that combines Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for AI-assisted software development.

## Overview

The Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Kit provides a structured approach to software development that emphasizes:
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Building software around business domains and concepts
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests first to drive implementation quality
- **Specification-First Approach**: Defining clear specifications before coding
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leveraging AI tools to accelerate the development process

This kit provides templates, workflows, and AI persona prompts to guide development teams through the complete SDD process, from initial domain discovery to final implementation.

## Key Components

### 1. Documentation Templates
Standardized templates for creating consistent, comprehensive documentation:
- [System Architecture Template](./templates/system-architecture-template.md)
- [Context Map Template](./templates/context-map-template.md)
- [Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template](./templates/prd-template.md)
- [Technical Design Template](./templates/technical-design-template.md)
- [Sprint Tracking Template](./templates/sprint-tracking-template.md)

### 2. Development Workflows
Structured processes for different types of projects:
- [Greenfield Development Workflow](./workflows/greenfield-workflow.md) - For new projects from scratch
- [Brownfield Development Workflow](./workflows/brownfield-workflow.md) - For existing systems and legacy code

### 3. AI Persona Prompts
Specialized prompts to guide AI assistants in SDD practices:
- [Domain Expert Persona](./prompts/persona-domain-expert.md) - For domain understanding
- [Architect Persona](./prompts/persona-architect.md) - For technical architecture
- [TDD Practitioner Persona](./prompts/persona-tdd-practitioner.md) - For test-driven development
- [DDD Practitioner Persona](./prompts/persona-ddd-practitioner.md) - For domain-driven design
- [SDD Assistant](./prompts/sdd-assistant.md) - For integrated SDD guidance

## Getting Started

### For New Projects (Greenfield)
1. **Domain Discovery**: Use the [Context Map Template](./templates/context-map-template.md) to understand your domain boundaries
2. **Requirements**: Create a [PRD using the template](./templates/prd-template.md)
3. **Architecture**: Design your system using the [Architecture Template](./templates/system-architecture-template.md)
4. **Implementation**: Follow the [Greenfield Workflow](./workflows/greenfield-workflow.md)
5. **Sprint Management**: Track progress with the [Sprint Template](./templates/sprint-tracking-template.md)

### For Existing Projects (Brownfield)
1. **Analysis**: Understand your existing system using the [Brownfield Workflow](./workflows/brownfield-workflow.md)
2. **Domain Modeling**: Extract domain concepts and create [Context Maps](./templates/context-map-template.md)
3. **Requirements**: Define changes using the [PRD Template](./templates/prd-template.md)
4. **Technical Design**: Plan changes with the [Technical Design Template](./templates/technical-design-template.md)
5. **Implementation**: Follow the [Brownfield Workflow](./workflows/brownfield-workflow.md)

## AI Integration

The SDD Kit includes specialized AI persona prompts that can be used with AI development tools to:

- Guide domain discovery and modeling
- Assist in creating specifications and documentation
- Provide TDD and DDD best practices
- Help with architectural decisions
- Support sprint planning and tracking

To use AI assistance with SDD practices, simply reference the appropriate persona prompt when interacting with your AI development assistant.

## Benefits of SDD

- **Domain Clarity**: Clear understanding of business domains and concepts
- **Specification Quality**: Comprehensive, well-defined requirements and specifications
- **Development Speed**: Accelerated development through AI assistance
- **Code Quality**: Higher quality code through TDD and DDD practices
- **Maintainability**: Easier maintenance through clear architecture and domain models
- **Team Alignment**: Consistent understanding through ubiquitous language

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Domain**: Always begin with domain understanding before technical decisions
2. **Use Templates Consistently**: Maintain consistency by using provided templates
3. **Apply TDD Discipline**: Follow red-green-refactor cycles for all implementations
4. **Maintain Ubiquitous Language**: Use consistent terminology across all documentation
5. **Iterate and Refine**: Continuously improve specifications and models as understanding deepens
6. **Leverage AI**: Use AI persona prompts to accelerate domain understanding and development
