# Templates

This directory contains standardized templates for creating documentation in the Spec-Driven Development methodology. Each template is designed to ensure consistency, completeness, and alignment with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Template List

### 1. System Architecture Template (`system-architecture-template.md`)
- Provides a comprehensive structure for documenting the system architecture
- Incorporates DDD concepts like bounded contexts and domain relationships
- Includes sections for technology stack, quality attributes, and security considerations
- Follows architectural best practices and patterns

### 2. Context Map Template (`context-map-template.md`)
- Facilitates the creation of domain context maps
- Defines ubiquitous language across bounded contexts
- Documents relationships between different parts of the system
- Ensures consistent terminology across the project

### 3. Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template (`prd-template.md`)
- Structures product requirements with focus on domain modeling
- Includes space for user stories, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements
- Integrates domain-driven design concepts in requirement gathering
- Provides traceability between user needs and technical implementation

### 4. Technical Design Template (`technical-design-template.md`)
- Outlines comprehensive technical design documentation
- Emphasizes implementation of domain models and services
- Includes API design, data design, and infrastructure planning
- Incorporates testing strategy aligned with TDD principles

### 5. Sprint Tracking Template (`sprint-tracking-template.md`)
- Provides structure for agile sprint planning and tracking
- Aligns sprint goals with domain-driven feature development
- Includes progress tracking and quality metrics
- Facilitates inspection and adaptation in the development process

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Select the appropriate template** based on the document type needed
2. **Fill in the document information** section with relevant details
3. **Complete each section** thoroughly, following the guidance provided
4. **Review with stakeholders** before finalizing
5. **Update regularly** as the project evolves
6. **Link related documents** to maintain traceability across the project

## Best Practices

- Use consistent terminology aligned with the ubiquitous language
- Ensure requirements traceability from domain concepts to implementation
- Include diagrams where they add value and clarity
- Regularly update documents to reflect current understanding
- Validate documents with domain experts and technical stakeholders
