# SDDK-RUL-0002 `init` Rules

- Distinguish clearly between greenfield and brownfield flows; never mix outputs without consent.
- For brownfield scans, document every assumption about the existing architecture and request user confirmation before finalizing artifacts.
- Glossary entries must use singular noun forms for aggregates and verbs for commands/events.
- Do not finalize the initiation brief without an explicit approval note from the user or designated stakeholder.
