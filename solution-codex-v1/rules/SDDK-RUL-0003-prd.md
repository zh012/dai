# SDDK-RUL-0003 `prd` Rules

- Capture acceptance criteria using the "Given/When/Then" format whenever feasible.
- Every requirement must map to a user need; reject scope creep unless tied to a clear metric.
- Maintain an "Open Questions" table synchronized with initiation artifacts.
- No PRD section may remain blank; use `Not Applicable (reason)` for exclusions.
