# SDDK-RUL-0005 `plan` Rules

- Do not assign a task without a matching design reference and PRD feature ID.
- Enforce WIP limits; flag when proposed assignments exceed limits.
- Capture review cadence (standups, demos, retros) with dates in the plan document.
- Mark blockers only if mitigation owners and due dates are specified.
