# Document Relationship Management

This document outlines how to maintain relationships between documents in the Spec-Driven Development kit to ensure traceability and consistency throughout the development process.

## Purpose of Document Relationships

Document relationships provide:

1. **Traceability** - Track how requirements flow through design to implementation
2. **Consistency** - Ensure changes in one document are reflected in related documents
3. **Context** - Provide understanding of how different parts of the system relate
4. **Validation** - Verify that implementation matches design and requirements

## Relationship Types

### Hierarchical Relationships
- Parent → Child (e.g., PRD → Feature Design)
- Whole → Part (e.g., System Design → Component Design)
- Abstract → Concrete (e.g., Architecture → Implementation)

### Sequential Relationships
- Predecessor → Successor (e.g., PRD → Design → Implementation)
- Input → Output (e.g., Requirements → Solution)
- Cause → Effect (e.g., Problem → Solution)

### Associative Relationships
- Related to (e.g., Feature A ↔ Feature B)
- Similar to (e.g., Pattern A ↔ Pattern B)
- Conflicts with (e.g., Requirement A ↔ Requirement B)

## Relationship Notation

### Within Documents
Use consistent notation to reference related documents:

```
**Related Documents**:
- DESIGN-2025-001 (Technical Design)
- PRD-2025-005 (Requirements)
- ARCH-2025-002 (Architecture Decision)
```

### Document Links
When using markdown, include both human-readable links and document IDs:

```
See the [Feature Design Document](../design/DESIGN-2025-001.md) (DESIGN-2025-001) for implementation details.
```

## Maintaining Relationships

### During Creation
1. **Identify** existing related documents before creating a new document
2. **Reference** parent documents that inform the new document
3. **Plan** for child documents that will be based on the new document

### During Updates
1. **Review** related documents to understand impact of changes
2. **Update** references in related documents if document ID changes
3. **Notify** owners of related documents about significant changes

### During Review
1. **Verify** that all forward references are valid
2. **Check** that backward references are accurate
3. **Validate** that relationship types are appropriate

## Relationship Validation

### Automated Checks
- Verify document ID format consistency
- Check for broken internal links
- Validate reference completeness

### Manual Reviews
- Assess relationship appropriateness
- Verify content alignment
- Check for missing relationships

## Tools for Relationship Management

### Cross-Reference Matrix
Maintain a matrix showing relationships between document types:

| From \ To | Init | PRD | Design | Plan | Execute |
|-----------|------|-----|--------|------|---------|
| Init      | -    | ✓   | ✓      |      |         |
| PRD       |      | -   | ✓      | ✓    |         |
| Design    |      |     | -      | ✓    | ✓       |
| Plan      |      |     |        | -    | ✓       |
| Execute   |      |     |        |      | -       |

### Dependency Tracking
Use issue tracking systems to maintain document dependencies:
- Link related work items
- Track document updates
- Notify stakeholders of changes

## Managing Changes

### Impact Assessment
When changing a document, assess impact on related documents:

1. **Identify** all documents that reference the changing document
2. **Evaluate** whether each related document needs updates
3. **Prioritize** updates based on relationship importance
4. **Schedule** updates to maintain consistency

### Change Propagation
- Document changes in a change log
- Update all related documents
- Communicate changes to stakeholders
- Verify relationship integrity after changes

## Common Relationship Patterns

### Requirements Flow
```
PRD → Design → Plan → Execute → Test → Deploy
```

### Design Hierarchy
```
System Architecture → Bounded Context → Component Design → Implementation
```

### Iterative Relationships
```
Feedback → Update PRD → Update Design → Update Plan → Re-execute
```

## Quality Assurance

### Completeness
- All required relationships are established
- No orphaned documents exist
- Traceability chain is complete

### Accuracy
- Relationships are correctly classified
- Forward and backward references align
- Document content matches relationship type

### Consistency
- Relationship notation is uniform
- Similar relationships are treated consistently
- Updates are propagated properly

## Best Practices

1. **Document relationships early** - Establish relationships during planning
2. **Keep relationships simple** - Avoid over-complicating connections
3. **Review regularly** - Periodically verify relationship accuracy
4. **Communicate changes** - Notify stakeholders of relationship changes
5. **Use tools** - Leverage tools to visualize and manage relationships
6. **Maintain traceability** - Preserve the chain from requirements to implementation
