# Test-Driven Development Integration

This document explains how to apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles within the Spec-Driven Development kit to ensure quality and correctness at every stage of the development process.

## Core TDD Concepts

### The TDD Cycle
The TDD cycle should be reflected in all technical documentation:
1. **Red** - Write a failing test based on requirements
2. **Green** - Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor** - Improve code while maintaining test coverage

### Three Laws of TDD
- You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test
- You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail
- You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the failing test

## TDD in Each Development Phase

### Project Initialization (init)
- Identify quality attributes that tests will verify
- Define testing strategy and principles
- Establish test automation infrastructure requirements
- Plan for testing culture and practices

### PRD Creation (prd)
- Define acceptance criteria for each feature
- Specify testable requirements with clear success criteria
- Include non-functional requirements that can be tested
- Document quality gates and testing requirements

### Solution Design (design)
- Design for testability from the beginning
- Identify test scenarios during design
- Plan test infrastructure and tools
- Consider testing in architectural decisions

### Task Planning (plan)
- Estimate time for writing tests
- Plan test creation with implementation
- Schedule testing activities and milestones
- Identify test environments needed

### Task Execution (execute)
- Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Write tests before implementation code
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Refactor based on test feedback

## Testing Strategy Integration

### Test Pyramid Implementation
Documents should reflect the test pyramid approach:

#### Unit Tests
- Should be the majority of tests
- Fast execution and isolation
- Focus on individual functions/classes
- Document expected unit behaviors

#### Integration Tests
- Test collaboration between components
- Verify interface contracts
- Include database and external service interactions
- Document integration scenarios

#### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify system behavior from user perspective
- Include critical user journeys
- Document user acceptance scenarios

### Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)
- Collaborate with stakeholders to define acceptance tests
- Use acceptance tests to drive development
- Document acceptance criteria clearly
- Ensure tests align with business requirements

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- Use Given-When-Then format in documents
- Focus on behavior from user perspective
- Create test scenarios based on user stories
- Document examples that clarify requirements

## Test Documentation Standards

### Test Case Format
In design documents, specify tests using a consistent format:
```
**Test Case ID**: TC-{FEATURE}-{NUMBER}
**Description**: Clear description of what is being tested
**Given**: Pre-conditions and initial state
**When**: Action or input that triggers behavior
**Then**: Expected outcome or behavior
**Priority**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
**Type**: Unit/Integration/End-to-End/Performance/Security
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
Define minimum coverage standards in documentation:
- Unit test coverage: 80% minimum
- Critical paths: 100% test coverage
- Mutation testing: 70% minimum
- Integration test coverage: Coverage of all major flows

### Testing Quality Gates
Establish quality gates in planning documents:
- All tests must pass before code is merged
- Coverage thresholds must be met
- Performance benchmarks must be satisfied
- Security tests must pass

## Document Structure for TDD

### Requirements Testing Section
Each PRD document should include:
- Testable acceptance criteria
- Examples and edge cases
- Performance requirements
- Success measurements

### Design Test Plan Section
Each design document should include:
- Testing approach and strategy
- Test scenario definitions
- Test data requirements
- Test environment specifications
- Test tool and framework selection

### Implementation Test Log Section
Each execution log should include:
- Tests written and executed
- Test results and outcomes
- Coverage achieved
- Performance metrics
- Issues discovered through testing

## TDD Practices in Documentation

### Living Documentation
- Keep tests and documentation synchronized
- Use documentation to explain test purpose
- Ensure tests verify documented behavior
- Update docs when tests change

### Specification by Example
- Include concrete examples with requirements
- Use real data in test scenarios
- Document the "why" behind tests
- Link examples to domain concepts

### Outside-In Development
- Start with high-level acceptance tests
- Drive implementation from outside in
- Use tests to define interfaces
- Document the development flow

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Definition of Done
Include testing requirements in the Definition of Done:
- All unit tests pass
- Acceptance tests pass
- Code coverage thresholds met
- Performance benchmarks satisfied
- Security tests passed

### Continuous Integration
Document CI requirements:
- Automated test execution
- Quality gate enforcement
- Test reporting and metrics
- Issue notification

### Code Review Standards
Include testing in code review checklists:
- New functionality has adequate tests
- Tests are clear and maintainable
- Edge cases are covered
- Performance implications considered

## TDD Metrics and Measurements

### Quality Metrics
Track and document these TDD metrics:
- Test coverage percentage
- Test execution time
- Number of defects found by type of test
- Code quality scores
- Time to fix defects

### Development Metrics
Monitor development effectiveness:
- Time spent writing tests vs. implementation
- Test-to-code ratio
- Test maintenance overhead
- Developer satisfaction with tests

## Tools and Infrastructure

### Testing Frameworks
Specify appropriate testing tools in design documents:
- Unit testing: Framework recommendations
- Integration testing: Tools and approaches
- Mocking libraries: Appropriate usage
- Test runners: Configuration and options

### Test Automation
Plan for test automation in task planning:
- Automated test execution
- Test environment setup
- Reporting and monitoring
- Maintenance procedures

## Integration with DDD

### Domain Testing
- Test domain invariants and business rules
- Verify aggregate boundaries through tests
- Use domain language in test names and descriptions
- Test domain events and event handling

### Behavior Validation
- Validate domain behaviors through tests
- Test domain service implementations
- Verify entity and value object behavior
- Check aggregate consistency rules

## Common TDD Pitfalls to Avoid

### Poor Test Design
- Tests that are too specific or brittle
- Tests that don't verify important behavior
- Over-mocking that doesn't test integration
- Tests that are hard to understand or maintain

### Incomplete Testing
- Missing edge cases
- Inadequate error handling tests
- Insufficient performance testing
- Lack of security testing

### Test Maintenance
- Tests that become outdated
- Overly complex test setups
- Tests that are hard to debug
- Neglected test refactoring
