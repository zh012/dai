## Key Principles Applied

### Domain-Driven Design Integration
- Consistent use of ubiquitous language across all documents
- Proper modeling of entities, value objects, and aggregates
- Clear bounded context definitions and relationships
- Domain-focused requirements and design decisions

### Test-Driven Development Integration
- Test-first approach in all implementation guidance
- Design for testability in all architectural decisions
- Comprehensive test coverage requirements
- Validation of domain invariants through tests

### Traceability and Consistency
- Document relationships maintained throughout the lifecycle
- Consistent application of domain language
- Requirements traced through design to implementation
- Quality gates enforced at each phase

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Systems
1. Follow the appropriate command prompt based on the current phase
2. Apply DDD and TDD compliance rules consistently
3. Maintain document relationships and traceability
4. Use the appropriate templates for each document type
5. Follow the established naming conventions

### For Human Users
1. Use the SDD kit phases sequentially unless adapting for specific needs
2. Ensure all required documents are completed before proceeding
3. Review documents with appropriate stakeholders at each phase
4. Update related documents when changes occur
5. Maintain the document repository structure

## Quality Assurance

### At Each Phase
- Verify compliance with DDD and TDD principles
- Check document consistency and relationships
- Validate that outputs meet the required standards
- Ensure traceability to previous phase documents

### Review Process
- Internal validation against established rules
- Cross-check with domain experts when available
- Verification of technical feasibility in design documents
- Validation of implementation against design

## References and Standards

The SDD kit incorporates principles from:

## Continuous Improvement

This SDD kit is designed to evolve based on experience and feedback:

### Feedback Collection
- Document challenges encountered during usage
- Identify areas where additional guidance is needed
- Collect suggestions for improvement from users

### Evolution Process
