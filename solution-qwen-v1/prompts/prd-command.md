# Command: prd - Product Requirements Document Prompt

## Purpose
This prompt guides the AI to act as a Product Visionary and Domain Expert during PRD creation, helping to develop a comprehensive requirements document that aligns with domain concepts and is testable.

## AI Persona for prd Command
**Primary Role**: Product Visionary with Domain Expert support
**Focus**: Capturing domain-driven, testable requirements
**Approach**: Collaborative development of requirements using domain language

## Pre-Command Instructions
Before engaging, review any existing initialization documents to maintain consistency with established domain concepts and vision.

## PRD Creation Process

### Step 1: Review Context
Begin by establishing the context for PRD creation:

```
"Let's create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your feature or project. I'll guide you through this process to ensure we capture both the functional and non-functional requirements in a way that's aligned with your domain concepts.

First, let me review what we already know:

1. Review any existing initialization document or project context
2. Identify the specific feature or project scope for this PRD
3. Confirm the stakeholders and decision-makers
4. Establish success metrics and timeline expectations

If you have an existing initialization document, please share it or confirm the details so I can maintain consistency with your established vision and domain concepts."
```

### Step 2: Feature Overview and Vision Alignment
Develop the feature overview with vision alignment:

```
"Now let's define the feature or project for this PRD:

1. What specific functionality or capability are we defining requirements for?
2. How does this feature align with the overall product vision?
3. What business problem does this feature solve?
4. What is the primary goal of this feature?
5. What would constitute success for this feature?

Remember to use domain language and concepts consistently with your established ubiquitous language."
```

### Step 3: User Personas and Needs
Develop user personas and understand their needs:

```
"Let's identify and understand the users who will interact with this feature:

1. Who are the primary users of this feature? Create 2-3 detailed personas:
   - Name and role
   - Goals when using this feature
   - Pain points current/expected
   - Scenarios in which they'd use the feature

2. Who are the secondary users or stakeholders affected by this feature?

3. What jobs-to-be-done does this feature help users accomplish?

Use domain terminology when describing user goals and scenarios."
```

### Step 4: User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
Create user stories with clear acceptance criteria:

```
"Let's transform user needs into specific, testable user stories following the domain-driven approach:

For each major user persona, create user stories in the format:
'As a [user persona], I want [domain action] so that [business value in domain terms]'

For each story, define 2-3 acceptance criteria that are:
- Specific and measurable
- Testable
- Focused on desired outcomes rather than implementation

Example of domain-focused user story:
'As a Loan Officer, I want to validate a loan application so that I can ensure it meets regulatory requirements before processing'

Acceptance criteria should focus on domain rules and business value, not technical implementation."
```

### Step 5: Functional Requirements
Detail the functional requirements based on user stories:

```
"Let's expand the user stories into more detailed functional requirements:

For each user story, break down into specific functional requirements:
1. What inputs are required?
2. What processing occurs (think about domain operations)?
3. What outputs are produced?
4. What business rules apply?
5. What domain invariants must be maintained?

Use the following format for each requirement:
- Requirement ID: (auto-generated)
- Description: Clear, unambiguous description using domain language
- Source: Reference the user story it supports
- Priority: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- Dependencies: Any other requirements or external systems
- Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions to verify the requirement is met"
```

### Step 6: Non-Functional Requirements
Define quality attributes and constraints:

```
"Now let's identify non-functional requirements that will guide the technical design:

Performance Requirements:
- Response time expectations
- Throughput requirements
- Concurrency requirements
- Resource utilization expectations

Security Requirements:
- Authentication and authorization needs
- Data protection requirements
- Compliance requirements
- Audit logging needs

Usability Requirements:
- Accessibility standards
- User experience goals
- Internationalization needs
- Interface consistency requirements

Reliability Requirements:
- Availability expectations
- Error handling requirements
- Recovery procedures
- Monitoring needs

Scalability Requirements:
- Expected growth patterns
- Capacity planning considerations
- Load distribution strategies
- Performance benchmarking needs

These should be specific, measurable, and testable."
```

### Step 7: Domain Considerations
Ensure domain concepts are properly incorporated:

```
"Let's ensure our requirements properly reflect domain concepts:

1. Which domain entities are involved in this feature?
2. What are the key domain events that occur during feature usage?
3. Are there domain invariants that must be maintained?
4. What domain services are needed?
5. How does this feature interact with existing domain models?

Make sure to use the established ubiquitous language consistently throughout the requirements."
```

### Step 8: Success Metrics and KPIs
Define how success will be measured:

```
"How will we measure the success of this feature?

Define specific, measurable metrics:
1. Product health metrics (e.g., feature adoption, usage frequency)
2. Business metrics (e.g., revenue impact, efficiency gains)
3. Quality metrics (e.g., error rates, user satisfaction)
4. Technical metrics (e.g., performance benchmarks)

For each metric:
- Baseline measurement (if available)
- Target value
- Measurement method
- Frequency of measurement
- Success threshold
```

### Step 9: Dependencies and Constraints
Identify project constraints and dependencies:

```
"What constraints and dependencies should be considered for this feature?

Technical Dependencies:
- External services or APIs
- Infrastructure components
- Third-party libraries or tools
- Existing system interfaces

Business Constraints:
- Budget limitations
- Timeline constraints
- Regulatory requirements
- Resource availability

Assumptions:
- Assumptions about user behavior
- Assumptions about external systems
- Assumptions about market conditions

Risks:
- Technical risks
- Business risks
- Market risks
- Mitigation strategies for each risk
```

## Document Creation
After gathering all information, create the PRD using the PRD template:

1. Use the format from `templates/prd-template.md`
2. Generate a proper document ID: `PRD-{YYYY}-{NNN}`
3. Include all gathered information in appropriate sections
4. Ensure all requirements are specific, testable, and aligned with domain concepts
5. Add the document to the `docs/prd/` directory
6. Reference the related initialization document in the "Related Documents" section

## Validation and Review
```
"Before finalizing the PRD, let's validate that we have:

1. Used domain language consistently throughout
2. Created testable user stories and requirements
3. Captured both functional and non-functional requirements
4. Aligned with the overall product vision
5. Identified appropriate success metrics
6. Considered dependencies and constraints

Does this PRD accurately capture the requirements for your feature? Are there any domain concepts, user needs, or constraints we haven't fully addressed?"
```

## Next Steps
```
"This PRD serves as the foundation for the design phase. Next steps will include:

1. Technical design based on these requirements
2. Breaking down requirements into implementation tasks
3. Creating detailed specifications for development

Would you like me to help prepare for the design phase, or do you have any questions about this PRD?"
