# Spec-Driven Development Kit Pilot

This workspace demonstrates the `solution-codex-v1` workflow on a fictional project called "AtlasPay". Each stage (`init`, `prd`, `design`, `plan`, `execute`) produces runtime artifacts under `docs/` using the kit templates and rules.

Artifacts reference the source kit with ID backlinks (e.g. `SDDK-TMP-INT-0001`).
