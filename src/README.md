# SDD Kit - Spec-Driven Development Kit

A comprehensive, AI-assisted software development toolkit based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. This kit provides structured artifacts and guided processes for software development from project initialization through implementation.

## 🎯 Purpose

The SDD Kit guides AI agents through a structured development process that ensures:
- **Business Value Alignment**: All technical decisions map to business requirements
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in quality checks at every development phase
- **Traceability**: Complete traceability from requirements to implementation
- **Consistency**: Standardized document formats and AI behavior patterns

3. **Technical Solution Design** (`/design`)
   - Architecture decision matrices
   - Technology evaluation and selection
   - Pattern-based design recommendations
   - Implementation roadmap creation

4. **Sprint Planning** (`/plan`)
   - Task breakdown from technical designs
   - Capacity-based resource allocation
   - Risk assessment and mitigation planning
   - Progress tracking templates

5. **Task Execution** (`/execute`)
   - Guided TDD implementation
   - Continuous quality monitoring
   - Code review preparation
   - Progress documentation

### AI Persona System

Each command leverages specialized AI personas:

- **System Initialization Architect**: DDD and strategic design expert
- **Product Manager**: Requirements discovery and user experience specialist
- **Technical Architect**: Solution design and technology evaluation expert
- **Project Coordinator**: Agile planning and team orchestration specialist
- **TDD Co-pilot**: Test-driven development and code quality mentor

## 📋 Document Templates

All documents follow standardized templates with:
- **Unique IDs**: Systematic naming (e.g., PRD-2025-01-15-001)
- **Metadata Section**: Author, version, status, and link network
- **Content Structure**: Consistent sections for easy navigation
- **Relationship Links**: Automatic cross-referencing between documents

### Available Templates

- **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: Business requirements and user stories
- **ARCH (Architecture Document)**: System architecture and design patterns
- **DES (Technical Design Document)**: Detailed implementation guidance
- **SPR (Sprint Planning Document)**: Development task organization
- **IMP (Implementation Document)**: Progress tracking and completion
- **CM (Context Map)**: DDD bounded context relationships
- **UL (Ubiquitous Language)**: Domain terminology glossary
- **RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)**: Requirement flow tracking

## 🤖 AI Behavior Rules

### Core Principles
1. **Domain-Driven Design Focus**: Maintain business context throughout
2. **Test-Driven Development Discipline**: Enforce test-first methodology
3. **Documentation Excellence**: Ensure comprehensive, current documentation
4. **Quality Assurance**: Maintain high standards at every phase

### Quality Standards
