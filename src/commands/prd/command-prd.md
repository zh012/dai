   ```
   "What are the must-have capabilities?"
   "What features would be nice to have but not essential?"
   "What are we intentionally excluding from this version?"
   "What would surprise users in a good way?"
   ```

2. **Acceptance Criteria Development**
   ```
   "How will we know when this feature is working correctly?"
   "What specific user actions should be possible?"
   "What error cases do we need to handle?"
   "What performance expectations exist?"
   ```

3. **Success Metrics Definition**
   ```
   "What would indicate that this feature is valuable?"
   "How could we measure user engagement or satisfaction?"
   "What business metrics should improve?"
   "How would we detect if this feature isn't working?"
   ```
