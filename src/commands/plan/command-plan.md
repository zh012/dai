# Command: plan - Sprint Planning and Task Breakdown

## Purpose
Transform technical design documents into actionable development tasks, create comprehensive sprint planning documents, and establish detailed task tracking systems with clear acceptance criteria, resource allocation, and progress monitoring.

## Command Format
```
/plan <sprint_name> [options]
```

### Options
- `--design=[design_id]` - Link to technical design document
- `--duration=[weeks]` - Sprint duration (default: 2 weeks)
- `--capacity=[hours]` - Team capacity in hours
- `--team-size=[number]` - Number of team members
- `--velocity=[points]` - Expected team velocity
- `--quick` - Streamlined planning process

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Task Extraction and Analysis
```
Loading project coordinator persona...
Analyzing linked technical design document...
Extracting implementation requirements...
Identifying task dependencies...
```

### Phase 2: Interactive Capacity and Resource Planning (20-35 minutes)

#### Team Assessment Session
1. **Team Composition Analysis**
   ```
   Let's understand your team structure for this sprint...

   "How many developers do you have on your team?"
   "What are their specific skill sets and expertise?"
   "Do you have dedicated QA or DevOps team members?"
   "What's the experience level mix in your team?"
   ```

2. **Availability and Capacity Planning**
   ```
   "What's your actual availability for development work?"
   "How many hours per developer can be committed to sprint?"
   "Are there any holidays, vacations, or conferences during sprint?"
   "Do you have any external meetings or ceremonies?"
   ```

3. **Skills and Expertise Matching**
   ```
   "Let's match tasks to team skills based on the design requirements..."

   Based on DES-2025-01-15-001: Customer Dashboard Technical Design
   "Who has experience with real-time web applications?"
   "Who has worked with PostgreSQL and Redis?"
   "Who has Socket.io or WebSocket experience?"
   "Who has experience with React and Material-UI?"
   ```

#### Sprint Scope and Priority Discussion
1. **Feature Prioritization**
   ```
   "Looking at the design document, let's prioritize the work..."

   **Critical Path Items** (Must complete first):
   - Core domain models and repositories
   - Authentication/authorization framework
   - Basic API structure

   **High Business Value Items**:
   - Dashboard data service
   - Real-time update mechanism
   - Mobile-responsive UI

   **Which items are most critical for your sprint goal?"
   ```

2. **Technical Dependencies Analysis**
   ```
   "Let's identify the technical dependencies..."

   **Sprint 1 Dependencies**:
   - Development environment setup → All other tasks
   - Database schema → Domain models
   - Authentication framework → All user-facing features
   - Infrastructure setup → CI/CD integration

   **Which order makes most sense given your team structure?"
   ```

3. **Risk and Uncertainty Assessment**
   ```
   "Let's identify and plan for technical risks..."

   **Potential Risks in Customer Dashboard Implementation**:
   - Real-time performance under concurrent users
   - Legacy system integration complexity
   - Mobile responsiveness across devices
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing

   **"Which risks concern you most? How should we mitigate?""
   ```

### Phase 3: Detailed Task Breakdown and Estimation

#### Task Decomposition Process
```
Breaking down technical design into specific development tasks...
Estimating effort and assigning priorities...
Identifying cross-dependencies and conflicts...
Creating comprehensive task definitions...
```
