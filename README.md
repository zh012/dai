# This is experiment to generate Spec-Driven Development framwork with AI Agents

I tried to create the framework by feeding the [META-PROMPTS](./META-PROMPTS.md) to different agents

- Gemini cli
- Codex
- Qwen Code
- Claud Code + Kimi K2
- Cursor

The Claud Code + Kimi K2 version is finally picked.

# TODO

[ ] Create installation scripts for mainstream AI coding agentes, like Cursor, Claude Code and Qwen Code.
